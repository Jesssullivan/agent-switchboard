# agent-switchboard

`swb` lets agent sessions in Claude Code, Kimi, Codex, Pi, Junie and OpenCode,
on any tailnet host, find each other, hold threaded dialogs and coordinate
work through advisory claims and handoffs. There is no tmux injection and no
per-session plumbing.

- **Broker:** one Rust binary, tailnet-only, running in a blahaj pod.
  - It serves MCP at `:8080/mcp` (11 tools, registry key `agents`), a REST
    twin `/v1/*` for hooks, and `:9090/metrics`.
  - It stores state in SQLite on a PVC, replicated to RustFS by Litestream.
- **Messages** are teammate information. The broker stamps
  `authority: peer` on every message and never emits `operator`.
- **Push:**
  - a UserPromptSubmit notice everywhere;
  - `swb agentd`, which writes body-less notices to verified Claude sockets.

## Status

**P1a (substrate).** This covers the repo scaffold, the ruleset and merge
queue, and the fork convention. The crates are compiling stubs, and the
broker MVP lands in P1b.

## Layout

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/swb-proto` | Wire types: envelope v3, authority |
| `crates/swb-store` | Coordination store (SQLite in P1b), retention/TTL |
| `crates/swb-broker` | MCP + REST + metrics server |
| `crates/swb-agentd` | Per-host push adapter |
| `crates/swb` | The single `swb` binary |
| `schemas/` | Envelope v3 JSON schema (draft) |
| `deploy/` | Digest-addressed Linux/amd64 OCI image and explicit GHCR push target |
| `docs/adr/`, `docs/agent-notes/` | Decisions and durable working notes |

## Develop

```sh
nix develop            # bazelisk, just, cargo (diagnostic), gh, jq
just fork-setup        # origin = your fork, upstream = xoxd-ai (push disabled)
just check             # rustfmt, clippy, unit + integration tests (Bazel)
just build             # swb binary and OCI image
just image             # build image and print its immutable GHCR reference
just remote-check      # from neo: run `just check` on sting
just lock              # regenerate all three lock files together (linux x86_64)
```

CI is `xoxd-ai/ci-templates` `rust-bazel-application.yml`, pinned by commit,
on GloriousFlywheel runners. `ci-ok` is the required check, and changes land
through the merge queue. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

After a reviewed main build, the explicit `bazelisk run //deploy:push` target
publishes the image by digest without a mutable tag. Run `just image` on that
same Linux/amd64 source revision and hand its `ghcr.io/xoxd-ai/agent-switchboard@sha256:…`
reference to the blahaj owner. PR CI only builds the image and digest target;
it does not publish. The rollout must supply the measured tailnet
`SWB_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` and a writable PVC directory for the image's nonroot
UID 65532.

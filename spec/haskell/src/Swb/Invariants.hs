-- | The pure model's core invariants as LiquidHaskell refinement types
-- (R-C261). Swb.Model runs these definitions, so the code LiquidHaskell
-- checks is the code the QuickCheck properties exercise.
--
-- This module imports only base, so `just spec-liquid` (the flake check
-- `spec-liquid`) can check it alone with the LiquidHaskell GHC plugin. A plain
-- GHC build reads the annotations as comments.
--
-- What is proved here, and what is not:
--
--   * Per-thread seq. A thread's log is strictly decreasing newest first, and
--     its newest seq equals its length. So 'appendSeq' always appends a seq
--     above every earlier seq on that thread, and the seqs run 1, 2, 3, ....
--     The model keeps one log per thread and never prunes it, like
--     swb-store's thread_counters.
--   * Lease transitions. With no activity of its own, an agent's lease only
--     decays (live -> idle -> gone) and ended stays ended ('decayLemma').
--     End always yields ended ('endedLemma'); a refresh yields live
--     ('reviveLemma'). Those are the only edges the model's classify allows.
--   * Claims. A listed claim is unexpired ('activeClaims'), and its view is
--     orphaned exactly when its holder is gone ('viewClaim'). So a listed
--     claim's holder is not gone, or the claim is marked orphaned for
--     release. A claim operation refreshes its holder, so a holder is live
--     when the claim is recorded ('reviveLemma'). The model has no explicit
--     release, so that is as far as it goes.
--
-- Not proved: that Swb.Model threads its state through these functions
-- correctly (it is not LiquidHaskell-checked; the QuickCheck trace
-- properties cover it), and anything about the live broker.

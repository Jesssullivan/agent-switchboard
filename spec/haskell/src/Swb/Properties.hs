-- | Five parsimonious trace properties (R-C229). Each one replays a trace of
-- (operation, result) pairs and returns the violations it finds. They judge
-- results only, so the same checks run against the pure model and against
-- the live broker through Swb.Live.
--
--   1. leaseLifecycle      SWB-R09/peers(): observed lease states change only
--                          along legal transitions.
--   2. threadSeqDense      SWB-R14: per-thread seq is 1, 2, 3, ..., even after prune.
--   3. atLeastOnceUntilAck SWB-R09: no ack means redelivered; ack means never again.
--   4. exclusiveRefusal    SWB-R16: the only refusal is a second exclusive claim.
--   5. noOrphanAfterExpiry SWB-R16: listed claims are unexpired, and orphaned
--                          exactly when the holder is gone.
--
-- Unruled SWB-R16 cases are never asserted.
